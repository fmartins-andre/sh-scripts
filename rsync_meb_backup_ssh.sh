#Description: rsync the MEB backup to a remote location through ssh/rsync.
#Notes:
#      * It syncronizes the MEB backup folder to the remote destination.
#        As it is designed to work with a MEB weekly full backup and a series of incremental backups,
#        it'll create a week folder with the week number of the year, starting on sundays.
#        As it expect that every sunday there'll be a new backup chain started by a full MEB backup,
#        it'll create a new week folder and sync all backups of the week to it. This way, the week
#        backup chain will stay isolated from the other backup chains and may make easier to remove
#        older backup chains.
#      * This script will not remove any file for now. To cleanup old backup chains from source or
#        destination directories, you may need another script.
#      * This script was designed to be started by cron job or a systemd timer, so you may need to do your
#        own schedules.
#      * The 'backupUser' must have write permissions at the remote server.
#      * 'sendemail' package is required to send emails.
